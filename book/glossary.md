**AST - Abstract Syntax Tree**: A special kind of *tree* that holds information about the parsed source code of a program.    
**statically typed**: A language where type checking is performed at compile time. e.g. C, C++, C#, Java    
**dynamically typed**: A language where type checking is performed at runtime. e.g. JavaScript, Lox, Python, Ruby, Lua    
**strongly typed**: The type of an object is fixed and cannot be treated as a different type e.g. C#, Java, Python, Ruby, Lox    
**weakly typed**: The type of an object is able to be used interchangably as others (type coercion). e.g JavaScript, Visual Basic with `Option Strict off`.    
**data structure**: A structured area of memory that holds data. e.g. array, list, *tree*, *graph*    
**graph**: A *data structure* with references from each *node* to zero or more other *nodes* and may contain circular references (or cycles).    
**tree**: A strictly forward-referencing *graph* which may not contain cycles and each *node* must have exactly one path from the root *node*.    
**node**: The basic unit of data in a *graph* that contains information about the *edges* connected to that node.    
**edge (graph)**: A reference from one *node* to another. May have a direction.    
**recursion**: A thing that refers to itself.  A recursive function is a function that calls itself inside the function body.    
**meta-programming**: Code that adds to, or alters the running program code as a side-effect of its execution.  e.g. creating a class definition based on string input.
